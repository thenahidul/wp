<h5 class="tou">THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND CONTENT</h5>

<p>All transactions using SENT's services are between the transacting parties only. The Services may contain features and functionalities linking you or providing you with certain functionality and access to third party content, including Web sites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, and the Internet as a whole; you acknowledge that we are not responsible for such content or services. We may also provide some content to you as part of the Services. However, SENT is not an agent of any transacting party, nor are we a direct party in any such transaction. Any such activities, and any terms associated with such activities, are solely between you and the applicable third-party. Similarly, we are not responsible for any third party content you access with the Services, and you irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites and third-party content. We shall have no liability, obligation or responsibility for any such correspondence, purchase or promotion between you and any such third-party. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You are solely responsible for your dealings with any third party related to the Services, including the delivery of and payment for goods and services. Should you have any problems resulting from your use of any third party services, or should you suffer data loss or other losses as a result of problems with any of your other service providers or any third-party services, we will not be responsible unless the problem was the direct result of our breaches.</p>

<h5 class="tou">BLOCKING OF SERVICES</h5>

<p>We retain the right to block or otherwise prevent delivery of any type of Service, functionality, file, email or other communication to or from the Service as part of our efforts to protect the Service, protect our customers, or stop you from breaching these Terms and to comply with any appropriate laws.</p>

<h5 class="tou">BETA PROGRAM</h5>

<p>We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. Those Services would be marked beta and may not be as reliable as SENT's other services, so please keep that in mind when using beta releases.</p>

<h5 class="tou">OUR CONTENT, DATA, PROPERTIES</h5>

<p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws.

<p>It is important to respect the intellectual property of others. We respond to all reports of copyright infringement. In order to report these infringements, please file an Abuse Report from the dashboard page on SENT. Please include as much detail and content information as possible.</p>

<h5 class="tou">PAID ACCOUNTS</h5>

<p>Subscription Billing. Everyone can have a free account. If you need to send more files or bigger files than what the free plan offers, you will need to upgrade your subscription plan to what ever plan meets your needs. You can move between plans as needed. We'll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. You're responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn't override these laws.</p>

<p>No Refunds. You may cancel your SENT account at any time. Refunds are only issued if required by law. For example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to or renewing a paid account.</p>

<p>Downgrades. Your paid account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don't pay for your paid account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to the free level.</p>

<p>Changes. We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.</p>

You may opt out of promotional emails by following the instructions in those mails.</p>

<h5 class="tou">TERMINATION</h5>

<p>You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if:</p>

(a) you're in breach of these Terms, or
(b) you're using the Services in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users.

<p>We won't provide notice before termination where:</p>

(a) you're in material breach of these Terms,
(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or
(c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.

<p></p>
<h5 class="tou">DISCONTINUATION OF SERVICES</h5>

<p>We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we'll give you as much reasonable prior notice as possible under the circumstances. If we discontinue Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we'll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.</p>

<h5 class="tou">SERVICES "AS IS"</h5>

<p>We want to provide awesome Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SECURE BUCKET, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don't allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>

<h5 class="tou">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5>

<p>WE DON'T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR THE SECURE BUCKET, INC. OR ITS AFFILIATES' FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN'T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN'T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.</p>

<p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, THE SECURE BUCKET, INC., ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON'T BE LIABLE FOR:</p>

i. ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
ii. ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.

<p>THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SENT OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p>IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, THE SECURE BUCKET, INC., ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. THE SECURE BUCKET, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.</p>

<p>OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $8 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH THE SECURE BUCKET, INC.</p>

<h5 class="tou">RESOLVING DISPUTES</h5>

<p>We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against The Secure Bucket, Inc., you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@sentandsecure.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or The Secure Bucket, Inc. may bring a formal proceeding.</p>

<p>Judicial forum for disputes. You and The Secure Bucket, Inc. agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of New York, Nassau County. Both you and The Secure Bucket, Inc. consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, European Union member states) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn't affect those requirements.</p>

<h5 class="tou">CONTROLLING LAW</h5>

<p>These Terms will be governed by New York law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn't override those laws.</p>

<h5 class="tou">ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h5>

<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and The Secure Bucket, Inc. with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>

<h5 class="tou">WAIVER, SEVERABILITY & ASSIGNMENT</h5>

<p>The Secure Bucket's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. SENT may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>
